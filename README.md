# FixTexture

Converts all unassigned textures of models to their respectful modids

## Usage

Start up the script and it will ask you to copy the absolute path of your current projects resource folder.

In Intellij, you can just click on the `resources` folder and press `Ctrl+Shift+C`. That will copy the absolute path of your resources folder to your clipboard.

Example:

`C:\Users\User\Desktop\Mods\ModId\src\main\resources`
